# Lunar Transit Dates Enum

At a million miles away, we go well past the moon, and so get a chance to see the rear or dark side of the moon. Since the moon is phase-locked with Earth, we never see this side of the moon from Earth. However, thanks to DSCOVR, you can now see this spectacular view of the moon when it transits between the telescope and Earth. Just select the date and hit "Try It Out" button
