   * You can select whether or not this setting should be enabled by assigning the `enabled` field a
   * `true` or `false` value.
   *
   * Passing only the `enabled` field to this endpoint will not alter your current `list` of whitelist
   * entries. However, any modifications to your `list` of entries will overwrite the entire list. For
   * this reason, you must included all existing entries you wish to retain in your `list` in addition to
   * any new entries you intend to add. To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the
   * entries you wish to retain.
   *
   * You should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your
   * emails will not honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of [CAN-SPAM](https:
   * //sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage your sending reputation.
   *
   * The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email addresses or domains for which mail should
   * never be suppressed.
   *
   * For example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use
   * `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address whitelist setting instructs
   * Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other
   * words, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were
   * sent under normal sending conditions.
   *
   * @param onBehalfOf   Example: The subuser's username. This header
